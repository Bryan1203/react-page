        title: `Today Will Be a Good Day`,
        body: `As usual, our mornings began promptly at 6:00 AM. We started the day with a bland breakfast, 
        followed by our morning circle and a brief team meeting. Afterward, we mounted our bikes, ready 
        to continue our journey. But on this particular morning, there was something different in the air. 
        The sky stretched out brilliantly, a canvas of endless blue, and the landscape before us was a 
        breathtaking display of nature's splendor. The world seemed to have awakened to greet us with its beauty.
        Despite the picturesque surroundings, I couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had crept in. 
        It was the 51th day of our trip, and my body had grown accustomed to the rigors of the ride, but my 
        spirit was at an all-time low. The once thrilling adventure had now become routine, and nothing about it 
        sparked my interest anymore. I found myself daydreaming about ways to cut the journey short and get to 
        the stayover ASAP. However, everything changed in a matter of minutes. I was engaged in casual conversation 
        with my teammate, Matthew Waloski, as we pedaled side by side. The weather was exquisite, and I remarked 
        about its pleasantness. That's when Matthew turned to me with a twinkle in his eye and said, 
        'Today will be a good day.' His words seemed simple, yet they carried an inexplicable magic. Suddenly, it all 
        came flooding back to me—the reason I embarked on this journey, the desire to explore, to challenge myself, 
        to experience the world.`,

        title: `The Carnival`,
        body:`It was our first rest day of the trip; we decided to take a break and explore the nearby carnival. 
        Twenty-two of us crammed into the mid-size support van, our excitement building as we anticipated the 
        adventure ahead. Soon, we arrived at the carnival grounds. As a first timer experiencing a carnival in the 
        United States, I was mesmerized by the vibrant and lively atmosphere. The sights, sounds, and smells were unlike 
        anything I had ever encountered before. The carnival was a whirlwind of colors, and the air was filled with the 
        cheerful chatter of visitors. Our first adventure was a ride that spun us around, with the force pushing us against 
        the walls of the machine. The infectious laughter of my teammates filled the air, and I found myself unable to stop 
        laughing. It was exhilarating and liberating, a moment of pure joy. Eager for more excitement, we decided to take 
        on an even more challenging ride, one that rotated us a full 360 degrees. Due to limited seats on the machine, we 
        took turns, each of us eagerly awaiting our chance. When it was my teammate Rick Ooi's turn, the transformation was 
        remarkable. He couldn't stop screaming, his cries resembling a chicken's frantic clucking. Although it might have 
        been a scary experience for Rick, we couldn't help but burst into fits of laughter. His contagious fear made us 
        laugh even harder. The laughter became infectious, spreading through the carnival like wildfire. The entire place was 
        filled with the sound of merriment and happiness. It was a moment of unbridled joy, and in that carnival, on that 
        exhilarating day, I experienced one of the happiest moments of my life.`,

        title: "Introduction",
        body: `During my freshman year, I noticed 'Illini 4000 Cycle Across the US' on Quad Day. Having a background in Olympic triathlons and high school cycling, the idea of biking across the US intrigued me. The desire for a new bike and the prospect of saying I've 'cycled across the US' led me to sign up. The dream became reality as we flew from Chicago to New York, marking the start of an extraordinary journey. 

        In the following you could view my story sequentially from New York to California, some states that are labeled with light red are some of my favorite stories. 
        
        *Note: The stories in states Minnesota and Wyoming actually took place in South Dakota due to technical issues and numerous events in that SD.

        title: `Why we ride`,
        body: `On the 14th day of our Illini4000 journey, we maintained our tradition of discussing "why we ride." Although we 
        had already explored this topic on day 0, the purpose of revisiting it was to acknowledge the stronger bond we'd forged after 
        two weeks of riding and living together. We found ourselves gathered in the cozy living room of our stayover in Lafayette, Indiana.
        Our ride leaders, Marie, and Julissa initiated the storytelling, and one by one, we shared our motivations. Angela's experience 
        left an indelible mark on all of us. She had begun the discussion as the chatty and humorous one among us, often making witty comments. 
        But when the time came for her to share her story, her demeanor changed. Angela's voice quivered as she recounted her childhood, the 
        hidden pain behind her ever-present smile. She confided that she used laughter as a shield, a way to conceal the deep sadness she 
        carried since her father was diagnosed with lung cancer and subsequently passed away when she was just 12 years old. The room fell 
        silent as we absorbed the weight of her revelation. Behind the facade of her perpetually cheerful face, she had carried the heartache 
        of loss, something none of us had ever suspected. Next was Valerie, a senior hailing from Ukraine. She shared that her reason for 
        embarking on this journey was to find a place where she truly belonged. Most of my teammates had stories intertwined with cancer and 
        personal fears. As for me, I hadn't shared my own story earlier because.my motivation seemed rather straightforward compared to the 
        deeply moving stories I'd just heard. For me, the idea of biking across the country represented a golden opportunity to explore the 
        nation and fulfill my dream of owning a road bike. However, as our discussion continued, I began to see things differently. Supporting 
        my teammates and carrying their stories with me became one of the reasons I continued to ride. The richness of their experiences and 
        their willingness to share had deepened our connection, transforming our journey from a simple cross-country ride into a mission of unity 
        and support, bonded by the strength of our collective stories.

        title: "Broken Dearaileur Hanger",
        body: `On the 33rd day of our journey, the sun beating down on us, I pedaled alongside Matthew W, Maddie, and Rick. The previous day, my bike had fallen over when parked, bending the derailleur hanger and causing pesky shifting issues.
        At a rest stop, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with determination, I attempted to bend the derailleur hanger back into place. Despite my efforts, the shifting problems persisted. On a hill, attempting to downshift, disaster struck – the chain slipped off, and I found myself pedaling without traction, then abruptly hitting the ground.
        Thankfully, the low speed spared me from injury, but the derailleur cage wasn't as fortunate. With a bent cage, I had to admit defeat and sag for the rest of the day. Surprisingly, I didn't mind the break, welcoming the chance to recover after weeks of riding. Moreover, with the knowledge that we were having a rest day in a few days, I was confident I could fix my bike. 
            The next day, I took a break, enjoying a road trip with Matt W to tour the 1880 Town. Later, Marie, our ride leader, generously offered her bike, not wanting me to miss the chance to ride through the Badlands. Intrigued by the excitement around the "Badlands," I decided to use Marie's bike, putting my broken one aside. While enjoying different parts of the trip, I soon found myself missing my own bike after taking a ride on Marie's. Check out "Marie’s Bike" for more details.
        Upon reaching Walls, SD, I discovered the nearest bike shop was in Rapid City. Thankfully, with a rest day in Walls, we seized the opportunity to make the trip, hoping to find a replacement derailleur. However, the bike shop presented a dilemma - the only compatible option exceeded my budget, but determined to continue the journey, I reluctantly purchased the overpriced Ultegra derailleur with a clutch.
        Returning to Walls, SD, I replaced my rear derailleur without a hitch. Despite the challenges, the whole ordeal became a surprisingly fun experience during the trip.

        title: "The Best Burger",
        body: `That day marked our 38th day of the trip, and the anticipation was palpable as we looked forward to witnessing the iconic 
        "President Rocks," better known as Mount Rushmore. Ever since my 10th-grade U.S. history class, I had carried the vivid image of 
        this remarkable landmark in my mind. Zona, Vikram, and I were brimming with excitement, and our steps quickened with enthusiasm. 
        As we journeyed towards our destination, I remember my heart racing at an astonishing 206 beats per minute just to keep up with 
        Vikram, and I thought I might gas out at any moment. But when we finally reached the summit, exhaustion was the farthest thing 
        from our minds, as we were greeted by breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. Vikram, with his characteristic enthusiasm, 
        pointed out that the "President Rocks" were on the other side of the mountain, igniting our excitement even more. After a brief 
        rest on the mountaintop, we resumed our adventure. The closer we got, the more awestruck we became by the historical significance 
        of this place. Soon, we arrived at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, and the feeling of having something I'd only seen in pictures 
        right in front of me left me gazing in wonder. We parked our bikes and embarked on a tour of the memorial, marveling at the grandeur 
        of the stone-carved presidents' faces. As we descended from the heights of Mount Rushmore to the welcoming, historical town of Custer,
         SD, my hunger had reached its peak. The grueling ride had left me ravenous, and I couldn't wait to satisfy my appetite. Custer, with 
         its charming streets lined with historical buildings, added a unique charm to our journey. When we entered the Black Hills Burger 
         and Bun Co., we found it packed with locals and tourists alike, a testament to its reputation. We had to wait for about 20 minutes 
         for a table, but the aroma of sizzling burgers in the air only whetted our appetites further. To my surprise, the burger I ordered 
         there turned out to be the best I've ever had in my life. The combination of the incredible hunger I felt after the challenging ride,
          the historical ambiance of Custer, and the burger's mouthwatering taste made it an unforgettable experience. The sauce was a 
          delectable blend that complemented the burger perfectly. To this day, I still haven't found a burger that can match the 
          mouthwatering delight of that Black Hills burger. It became not just a meal but a lasting memory of that unforgettable day in 
          South Dakota.`,

        title: "Marie’s Bike",
        body: `During our 33rd day of the trip, a series of events led to my bike breaking, specifically the derailleur hanger. Thankfully, Marie, our ride leader, kindly offered her bike to ensure I wouldn't miss exploring Badlands National Park—a place highly anticipated by our team. Eager for the experience, I gladly accepted her offer, despite the mismatch in bike sizes and cleat systems between us.
        The day before our Badlands excursion, we attempted to swap the cleats to match my road bike setup, but the mountain bike cleat on Marie's bike proved stubbornly stuck, thwarting our efforts. At that moment, it didn't bother me much since I could wear a regular shoe while riding Marie's bike.
        Badlands National Park was unlike anything I had ever seen—the landscape was surreal, almost resembling scenes from distant countries or otherworldly settings. The excitement propelled us, leading to a spontaneous race up one of the hills. However, as the ride progressed, the discomfort of riding a smaller bike and using unfamiliar cleats began to take its toll.
        Pedaling without cleats felt awkward, restricting my foot position and causing exhaustion, especially during the last 20 miles. I struggled to keep pace with my teammates, feeling drained and fatigued. Nonetheless, despite the challenges, I remained grateful for the opportunity to ride through the park, courtesy of Marie lending me her bike.
        The experience was a blend of exhilaration and difficulty, a testament to the resilience required when faced with unexpected hurdles while exploring new places. I appreciated Marie's gesture and the chance to witness the remarkable beauty of Badlands National Park, despite the discomfort and exhaustion faced during the ride.
        Nevertheless, the memories created amidst the stunning landscape and the comradeship shared with my teammates made the ride through Badlands an unforgettable adventure.

        title: `Van broke down`,
        body: `On our 61st day of our trip, it was designated as a rest day for our team. We collectively chose to explore the vicinity around Mount Rainier. In the morning, we embarked on a hike around the mountain and I was astounded to witness snow in mid-August, marveling at the experience of traversing various terrains across different states.
        After completing the hike, we returned to our campground and decided to further explore by seeking out a nearby waterfall. It didn't take long before we discovered one. Some of us, including me, mustered the courage to jump into the water from the waterfall's edge. However, my nerves got the better of me, allowing only a single jump, unlike some of my teammates who leapt multiple times.
        As night fell, some of our teammates began experiencing headaches, possibly due to the abrupt pressure changes while cliff jumping. Rick swiftly took charge, driving them to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible. Navigating the mountainous terrain in the dark was no easy feat, but Rick did an admirable job getting our teammates the urgent care they needed and safely returning them to the campsite.
        The following day, upon awakening, we discovered that one of our tires had gone flat. Our ride leaders had never encountered such a situation—stranded in a campsite without service. None of us possessed the knowledge of how to replace a tire, and riding without our support van was not an option. Faced with this dilemma, several teammates and I decided to start a fire to keep warm while others sought help from fellow campers.
        Fortunately, we crossed paths with someone willing to assist us, equipped with the necessary tools. With their help, we managed to replace the tire and were able to ride off from the campsite by noon.
